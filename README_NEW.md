In this assignment we're going to analyze aiport data. We'll be downloading some data in a common file format, exploring it using Python to discover the distances of certain flights, and then creating a basic Histogram. 

This assignment can be divided into 4 challenge 

Challenge one was to print all of the airport names for a particular country
Challenge 2 - Reading the airport database and Writing the code to read through “airports.dat” and create a dictionary mapping from an airport ID key to the geographic coordinates
Challenge 3 - Route distances, using the code already wriiten we have to calcualte distance between two airport routes using route.dat file

Challenge 4 - Histogram ,challenge was to  create a histogram displaying the frequency of flights by distance

The difficulty that i faced was in distance function, as function was throwing error because we were passing string argument in the function but required was numeric/real number i.e float, so i just explicitly converted string to float number and then passed it to the function
